# shinyapp_NYC_Motor_Vehicle_Collision   

This is a Shiny App in R as a class project of 2018 Winter Data Science Bootcamp at [NYC Data Science Academy](https://nycdatascience.com).

The used ["NYC Motor Vehicle Collision"](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Motor-Vehicle-Collisions/h9gi-nx95) dataset was originally downloaded from New York City government OpenData website at Jan 20, 2018. It provides all the available NYC motor vehicle collision records by NYPD from July 1st, 2012 to Jan 16th, 2018, totally, 1194091 records.

The work done so far is   
1. provide a "map view" to help visualize the data on a city map, and 
2. some exploratory data analysis graphs of the data.

The full project app is available online at https://yanghua23.shinyapps.io/shinyapp_NYC_Motor_Vehicle_Collision/. 

A detailed summary presentation can be found at https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cKCIfQLJiUwfUUuLXcDBMbQyxzxN7h-fT-0xFjMEsuA/edit?usp=sharing.

(To run the app locally, you need download all the files into a local folder, use RStudio IDE to open any one of global.R, ui.R, or server.R files, and hit "Run App" button. Be sure to have installed all the needed R packages as listed in global.R.)

Any comments/suggestions/questions are very welcome.

Thank you!
